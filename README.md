## About The Project

This week we started learning a new language: R. I will be putting my knowledge to test by trying to analyze data collected on website visitors and users to identify the most responsive audience for cryptography course advertisements

I intend to find out whether we can use the datasets to come up with an audiences we should focus our adverrtisments on.

* I believe I was able to get some interesting insights from the analysis. see the PDF/ Html or RMD file for the insights

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I did this analysis with the intention of improving my skills in R. However, the code used could be replicated to get insights in other similar datasets.
